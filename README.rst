1. Introduction
---------------

Welcome to Equalizer, the standard middleware to create and deploy parallel,
scalable OpenGL applications. This release is a bugfix release for Equalizer
1.2.

Equalizer 1.2 culminates over seven years of development and decades of
experience into a feature-rich, high-performance and mature parallel
rendering framework and an object-oriented high-level network library. It is
intended for all application developers creating parallel, interactive OpenGL
applications. Equalizer 1.2.1 can be retrieved by downloading the `source
code`_ or one of the `precompiled packages`_.


1.1. Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Equalizer provides the following major features to facilitate the development
and deployment of scalable OpenGL applications. A `detailed feature list`_
can be found on the Equalizer website.

-   **Runtime Configurability:** An Equalizer application is configured
    automatically or manually at runtime and can be deployed on laptops,
    multi-GPU workstations and large-scale visualization clusters without
    recompilation.
-   **Runtime Scalability:** An Equalizer application can benefit from
    multiple graphics cards, processors and computers to scale rendering
    performance, visual quality and display size.
-   **Distributed Execution:** Equalizer applications can be written to
    support cluster-based execution. Equalizer furnishes and uses the Collage
    network library, a cross-platform C++ library for building heterogenous,
    distributed applications.
-   **Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments:** Equalizer supports
    stereo rendering head tracking, head-mounted displays and other advanced
    features for immersive Virtual Reality installations.

3. About
--------

Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit, designed to run on any modern
operating system, including all Unix variants and the Windows operating
system. A `compatibility matrix`_ can be found on the Equalizer website.

Equalizer requires at least `OpenGL 1.1`_, but uses newer OpenGL features
when available. Version 1.2 has been tested on:


3.1. Operating System Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Equalizer uses CMake to create a platform-specific build environment. The
following platforms and build environments are tested:

-   **Linux:** Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10, RHEL 6.1 (Makefile, i386, x64)
-   **Windows:** XP and 7 (Visual Studio 2008, i386, x64)
-   **Mac OS X:** 10.6, 10.7 (Makefile, XCode, i386, x64)


3.2. Window System Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-   **X11:** Full support for all documented features.
-   **WGL:** Full support for all documented features.
-   **AGL:** Full support for all documented features.


3.3. Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Programming and User Guide is available as a `hard-copy`_ and `online`_.
The `API documentation`_ can be found on the Equalizer website.

As with any open source project, the available source code, in particular the
shipped `examples`_ provide a reference for developing or porting
applications. The `Developer Documentation`_ on the website provides further
design documents for specific features. XCode users can download a
`Documentation Set`_.


3.4. Support
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Technical questions can be posted to the ` Developer Mailing List`_, or
directly to ` info@equalizergraphics.com`_.

Commercial support, custom software development and porting services are
available from `Eyescale`_. Please contact `info@eyescale.ch`_ for further
information.

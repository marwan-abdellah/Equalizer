1. Introduction

   Welcome to Equalizer, the standard middleware to create and
   deploy parallel, scalable OpenGL applications. This release
   is a bugfix release for Equalizer 1.2.

   Equalizer 1.2 culminates over seven years of development
   and decades of experience into a feature-rich,
   high-performance and mature parallel rendering framework
   and an object-oriented high-level network library. It is
   intended for all application developers creating parallel,
   interactive OpenGL applications. Equalizer 1.2.1 can be
   retrieved by downloading the source code or one of the
   precompiled packages.

  1.1. Features

   Equalizer provides the following major features to
   facilitate the development and deployment of scalable
   OpenGL applications. A detailed feature list can be found
   on the Equalizer website.

     * Runtime Configurability: An Equalizer application is
       configured automatically or manually at runtime and can
       be deployed on laptops, multi-GPU workstations and
       large-scale visualization clusters without
       recompilation.
     * Runtime Scalability: An Equalizer application can
       benefit from multiple graphics cards, processors and
       computers to scale rendering performance, visual
       quality and display size.
     * Distributed Execution: Equalizer applications can be
       written to support cluster-based execution. Equalizer
       furnishes and uses the Collage network library, a
       cross-platform C++ library for building heterogenous,
       distributed applications.
     * Support for Stereo and Immersive Environments:
       Equalizer supports stereo rendering head tracking,
       head-mounted displays and other advanced features for
       immersive Virtual Reality installations.

3. About

   Equalizer is a cross-platform toolkit, designed to run on
   any modern operating system, including all Unix variants
   and the Windows operating system. A compatibility matrix
   can be found on the Equalizer website.

   Equalizer requires at least OpenGL 1.1, but uses newer
   OpenGL features when available. Version 1.2 has been tested
   on:

  3.1. Operating System Support

   Equalizer uses CMake to create a platform-specific build
   environment. The following platforms and build environments
   are tested:

     * Linux: Ubuntu 11.04, 11.10, RHEL 6.1 (Makefile, i386,
       x64)
     * Windows: XP and 7 (Visual Studio 2008, i386, x64)
     * Mac OS X: 10.6, 10.7 (Makefile, XCode, i386, x64)

  3.2. Window System Support

     * X11: Full support for all documented features.
     * WGL: Full support for all documented features.
     * AGL: Full support for all documented features.

  3.3. Documentation

   The Programming and User Guide is available as a hard-copy
   and online. The API documentation can be found on the
   Equalizer website.

   As with any open source project, the available source code,
   in particular the shipped examples provide a reference for
   developing or porting applications. The Developer
   Documentation on the website provides further design
   documents for specific features. XCode users can download a
   Documentation Set.

  3.4. Support

   Technical questions can be posted to the Developer Mailing
   List, or directly to info@equalizergraphics.com.

   Commercial support, custom software development and porting
   services are available from Eyescale. Please contact
   info@eyescale.ch for further information.
